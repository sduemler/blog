## Digital Gardening

I first came across the idea of digital gardening from my friend Alex’s [blog](https://blog.alexo.dev/), which led me to rediscover cassidoo’s [blog](https://cassidoo.co/), who I had subscribed to in the early days of the pandemic. You should check them both out if you haven’t yet! If you have a keen eye you may notice a couple of small design similarities between my site and cassidoo’s, I shamelessly stole her open source template she has up on her Github. I spent days looking through different Gatsby and Jekyll starters looking for something similar to hers before finding out she provided a perfect template for what I was looking for. I’m especially a big fan of the color changing links!

I’ve wanted a space to write for a while now, but I’ve always shied away from the traditional blog format. I didn’t want to feel beholden to a certain subject or a purely linear through time layout. I really liked the idea of a digital garden, first purely from the oxymoronic nature of the term, then from the openness of idea arrangement. A bit more rough and ready, as Mary Berry would put it.

## Getting Thoughts Out

Ever since graduating college in 2019, I haven’t felt that I had a good creative outlet to write my thoughts. No one at work is going to ask me what I think about how a specific German fairy tale has been adapted over the years. Cornering my friends to explain the entire history of heavy metal or all the best ways to filter drinking water while camping seems like a quick way to not get invited over anymore. I didn’t want to add myself to the somehow endless list of white guys with podcasts. Thus - a white guy with a website!

## Learning in Public

I’ve always kept my learning and work very close to the chest. Despite calling myself a musician and songwriter, I’ve really only released a single song under a pseudonym, and didn’t even send it to anyone I know.  Seeing how keeping everything to myself isn’t doing wonders for my creative output, I think it’s worth to at least try out something different. Let’s see how it goes!
