Hello! I'm Sam, welcome to my ⭐ `digital garden` ⭐. I like to write words and make music. I code things for money, and occasionally for fun.

Based in Raleigh, NC. Chronically online.\
From Cincinnati &rarr; OG East Nashville &rarr; Raleigh

You can check out my posts by date to get a sense of my different tswift eras, or if you're a quirky non-linear thinker or are only interested in some of what I talk about you can check out the tags at the bottom.

The template for this site is shamelessly stolen from [cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co), she's cool and you should check her out!

Brush your teeth and do what you want!
